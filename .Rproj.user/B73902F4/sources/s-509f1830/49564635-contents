## Lab Tutorial

This week, we'll be exploring **sampling distributions**, which we've basically already seen: we're now going to formalize the idea. A sampling distribution refers to the possible values for a *statistic* and how often those values occur. We've seen these already: the histograms of $\hat{p}_{\mathrm{sim}}$ we've used to find p-values are sampling distributions for $\hat{p}$. 

Let's take a look at the penguins data again.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS250SBI/palmerpenguins/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png)

```{r penguins}
# Remember to set stringsAsFactors = TRUE!
penguins <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STATS250SBI/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins_NArm.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Let's remind ourselves of what variables are in this data:

| Variable name | Description |
|:--------------|:------------|
|`species`| Penguin species (Ad&eacute;lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) |
|`island`| Island in Palmer Archipeligo, Antarctica, on which the penguin was observed (Biscoe, Dream, or Torgersen) |
|`bill_length_mm`| A number denoting bill length (in millimeters) |
|`bill_depth_mm`| A number denoting bill depth (in millimeters) |
|`flipper_length_mm`| A whole number denoting flipper length (in millimeters) |
|`body_mass_g`| A whole number denoting penguin body mass (in grams) |
|`sex`| Penguin sex (female, male) |
|`year`| Study year (2007, 2008, 2009) |

```{r penguinsExplore, error = T}
# Use your favorite function or two to explore the data

```

> IMPORTANT NOTE: For the purposes of this example, we're going to assume that the penguins in the data represent the *population* of all penguins in the Palmer Archipelago. This is obviously not true: there are more than 333 penguins living on these islands. *This is just to illustrate ideas*. Keep that in mind.

Let's say we want to estimate the proportion of Gentoo penguins in the Palmer Archipelago. Assuming our data represents the whole population of penguins, we know the right answer to this: about 36% of penguins are Gentoos. We'll call this $p$, the population proportion of Gentoo penguins in the archipelago.

```{r speciesProportions}
# Pass a frequency table to the proportions() function to get proportions
proportions(table(penguins$species))
```

Before we get started with random sampling, we'll set the seed.

```{r setSeed}
set.seed(7923)
```

Generally, we can only take samples of populations. Let's take a sample of size 20 from the "population" of all penguins:

```{r penguinSample1}
sample1 <- penguins[sample(1:333, size = 20), ]
```

We should unpack this code a bit. We're creating a new `data.frame` called `sample1` that contains 20 randomly-sampled rows of `penguins`. We're choosing those rows using the `sample()` function on the vector `1:333` -- remember that there are 333 rows in the `penguins` data.frame. Once we've got our rows selected, we're going to "select" those rows of `penguins` using square brackets. 

Remember that data is **R**eally **C**ool, so we first tell R which **R**ows we want, then which **C**olumns. In `penguins[sample(1:333, size = 20), ]`, we're telling R we want the sampled rows of `penguins`, then we type a comma to tell R which columns we want, and we leave that *blank*. Doing this tells R we want *all* the columns. 

It's easiest to see what we've just done by looking at it. We should see 20 rows and all the columns.

```{r penguinSample1Viewer}
sample1
```

Now, let's see the proportion of Gentoo penguins in our sample ($\hat{p}$):

```{r sample1GentooProp}
proportions(table(sample1$species))
```

In our sample, we have $\hat{p} = 0.35$: based on this sample, we estimate that 35% of penguins in the Palmer Archipelago are Gentoos. Now, we know that if we took a different sample of size 20, we'd get a different estimate of $p$ (a different $\hat{p}$). So let's do it again!

```{r penguinSample2}
sample2 <- penguins[sample(1:333, size = 20), ] # reusing the same code as above
proportions(table(sample2$species))
```

In this new sample, we got $\hat{p} = 0.15$. We can get a better sense of what's going on by taking many samples of size 20: let's take 1000 samples (no reason why 1000 in particular; it's just a big number that's not *too* big) using our old friend `replicate()`. 

```{r penguinSamples20}
samplesOfSize20 <- replicate(1000, {
  s <- penguins[sample(1:333, size = 20), ]
  proportions(table(s$species))["Gentoo"]
})
```

```{r samples20hist}
hist(samplesOfSize20,
     main = "Sampling distribution of p-hat, n = 20",
     xlab = "p-hat values",
     col = "darkturquoise",
     xlim = c(0, 1))
# we'll now use abline to add a vertical line at p, the 'population' proportion
abline(v = proportions(table(penguins$species))["Gentoo"],
       lwd = 5, lty = "dashed", col = "darkblue")
```

What do you notice about this distribution?

> *Write what you notice about the distribution here*

Now let's switch things up and take larger samples: let's say $n = 40$. 

```{r penguinSamples40}
samplesOfSize40 <- replicate(1000, {
  s <- penguins[sample(1:333, size = 40), ]
  proportions(table(s$species))["Gentoo"]
})
```

```{r samples40hist}
hist(samplesOfSize40,
     main = "Sampling distribution of p-hat, n = 40",
     xlab = "p-hat values",
     col = "darkturquoise",
     xlim = c(0, 1))
# we'll now use abline to add a vertical line at p, the 'population' proportion
abline(v = proportions(table(penguins$species))["Gentoo"],
       lwd = 5, lty = "dashed", col = "darkblue")
```

How does this distribution compare to the `n = 20` distribution?

> *Replace this with your thoughts on the comparison*

Now let's try increasing the sample size to 100.

```{r penguinSamples100}
samplesOfSize100 <- replicate(1000, {
  s <- penguins[sample(1:333, size = 100), ]
  proportions(table(s$species))["Gentoo"]
})
```

```{r samples100hist}
hist(samplesOfSize100,
     main = "Sampling distribution of p-hat, n = 100",
     xlab = "p-hat values",
     col = "darkturquoise",
     xlim = c(0, 1))
# we'll now use abline to add a vertical line at p, the 'population' proportion
abline(v = proportions(table(penguins$species))["Gentoo"],
       lwd = 5, lty = "dashed", col = "darkblue")
```

Let's stack the histograms on top of each other so we can see them better. Don't worry about the code here as much as the visual.

```{r histogramStack, fig.height = 6, echo = F}
# Don't worry about this code! Just for illustration
oldpar <- par()
par(mfrow = c(3, 1), xpd = NA, mar = c(1, 4, 1, 1) + .1)
x <- c(20, 40, 100)
for (n in x) {
  if (n == x[length(x)])
    par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1) + .1)
  hist(get(paste0("samplesOfSize", n)),
     main = paste("1000 samples, n =", n),
     xlab = ifelse(n == x[length(x)], "p-hat values", ""),
     col = "darkturquoise",
     breaks = seq(0, 1, .05),
     xlim = c(0, 1),
     ylim = c(0, 400), xaxt = "n")
}
axis(side = 1, at = seq(0, 1, .1), labels = paste0(seq(0, 1, .1)))
segments(proportions(table(penguins$species))["Gentoo"], 0, 
         proportions(table(penguins$species))["Gentoo"], 2000, 
         lwd = 5, lty = "dashed", col = "darkblue")
```

We should notice three things about these plots:

1. **Center:** (fill this in)
2. **Variability:** (fill this in)
3. **Shape:** (fill this in)

What we're discovering here is called **the central limit theorem**:

> **Central Limit Theorem:** If we look at a proportion (or difference in proportions) and the scenario satisfies certain conditions, then the sample proportion (or difference in proportions) will appear to follow a bell-shaped curve called the *normal distribution*.

The two conditions we need to satisfy are:
1. **Observations in the sample are independent.** This is guaranteed if we have a random sample, or if we randomly divide individuals into treatment and control groups.
2. **The sample is large enough.** Here, "large enough" means $n\times p \geq 10$ and $n\times (1-p) \geq 10$, where $n$ is the sample size and $p$ is the *population proportion*. If we don't have $p$, we can usually use $\hat{p}$ as a good estimate.

## Try It!
Depending on your instruction method (in person, synchronous remote, asynchronous remote), complete the following exercises collaboratively. 

1. **In person:** Form groups of 2-4 with those around you (maintaining physical distance). Your instructor will provide additional details.
1. **Synchronous remote:** You will be placed in a Zoom breakout room to work together in small groups. 
1. **Asynchronous remote:** Join a Piazza lab group for asynchronous collaboration.

You may be interested in the below code from Lab 7 which may or may not come in handy. **DO NOT COPY THE CHUNK SYNTAX**.

```{r, include = F, eval = F}
pHatDiffs <- replicate(1000, {
  shuffle <- sample_two_groups(dvd)
  shuffle_table <- rowTable(shuffle)
  shuffle_table[2, 2] - shuffle_table[1, 2] # p-hat_treatment minus p-hat_control
})

sum(pHatDiffs >= 0.20)
```

This week we will be working with data from the Stats 250 beginning of term student survey, specifically the question asking "Would you rather suddenly become CEO of a company or suddenly become a Senator?"

>**1.** Before the survey, the instructional team members thought that a majority of Stats 250 students would prefer to suddenly become a CEO (over suddenly becoming a Senator). Recall that in the survey, students only had two choices: CEO or Senator. Write the appropriate hypotheses below to test for whether a majority of Stats 250 students would prefer to suddenly become a CEO.

- $H_0$: replace this text with your null hypothesis
- $H_A$: replace this text with your alternative hypothesis


> **2.** The data can be found in 'student_survey.csv'. Read in the data and call it 'student_survey'.

```{r tryIt2, error = T}
# Replace this comment with code required for Try It 3. (Remember that this text is a comment, so R ignores it; you can delete it if you want.) If you don't delete it, **start your code on a new line that doesn't start with #**

```

> **3.** This data set contains every student who took the survey in Stats 250. This is quite a large number, so we will instead grab a random sample of students from the data. Take a sample of the size of your choice using code. Make sure you give it a name! Why did you pick that size for your sample?

```{r tryIt3, error = T}
# Replace this comment with code required for Try It 3. (Remember that this text is a comment, so R ignores it; you can delete it if you want.) If you don't delete it, **start your code on a new line that doesn't start with #**

```

Replace this text with your answer to Try It 3.

> **4.** We will use a total of 100 poker chips to simulate the null hypothesis model. Fill in the blanks: In order to conduct the simulation, a researcher decided that a blue poker chip represents ______(a)______ and a yellow poker chip represents ______(b)______. There will be _____(c)_____ blue poker chips and _____(d)_____ yellow poker chips. To perform the simulation, we will mix the blue and yellow poker chips, select ______(e)______ from the bag, and record the color before replacing the chip in the bag. The researcher will pick ______(f)______ times to complete the simulation. Then he will count how many ______(g)______ poker chips he has and divided by ______(h)______ to find the simulated proportion.

Replace this text with your answer to Try It 4.

> **5.** We would repeat the procedure above over and over until we reached 1000 simulations. Write the code that would do this action of 1000 simulations. Use this information to make a histogram of the simulated proportions. Then estimate the p-value and determine the conclusion of the hypothesis test.

```{r tryIt5, error = T}
# We've got some code to help you get started here. Fill in the blanks in the code with your numbers from Try It 4. When you fill in the blanks, REMOVE THE UNDERSCORES COMPLETELY.Your code won't run otherwise.

chip <- c(rep("blue", ___(c)___), rep("yellow", ___(d)___))
pHatSims <- replicate(1000, {
  # use the sample() function to draw samples of size (e) from the vector called
  # chip. be sure to set replace = TRUE inside of sample(). Only put your code
  # HERE, do NOT type outside of the curly braces.
})

```

Replace this text with your answer to Try It 5.

> **6.** The instructional team also wonders if the answer to the "CEO or Senator" question differs between students who typically have jobs during the semester and those who don't. Write the appropriate hypotheses below to test for whether there is a difference in proportions between students with jobs and without jobs who would prefer to suddenly become a CEO.

- $H_0$: replace this text with your null hypothesis
- $H_A$: replace this text with your alternative hypothesis

> **7.** Make a frequency table of your sample data from Try It 3 so that you can address these hypotheses. Note that the `job` variable is coded so that "Yes" means "I typically have a job during the school year". What is the observed difference in proportions?

```{r tryIt7, error = T}
# Replace this comment with code required for Try It 7. (Remember that this text is a comment, so R ignores it; you can delete it if you want.) If you don't delete it, **start your code on a new line that doesn't start with #**

```

> **8.** In Try It 3, we found a random sample of a particular size from the data. We can use that same random sample to analyse our new hypotheses. 
Fill in the blanks: In order to conduct the simulation, a researcher wrote ______(a)______ on ______(b)______ index cards and ______(c)______ on ______(d)______ index cards to indicate whether or not a person ______(e)______. Then he shuffled the cards and dealt them into two groups of size ______(f)______ for ______(g)______ and size ______(h)______ for ______(i)______. He counted how many participants in each simulated group ______(j)______, and calculated the difference between the simulated proportions.

Replace this text with your answer to Try It 8.

> **9.** We would repeat the procedure above over and over until we reached 1000 simulations. Write the code that would do this action of 1000 simulations. Use this information to make a histogram of the simulated differences in proportions. Then estimate the p-value and determine the conclusion of the hypothesis test.

```{r tryIt9, error = T}
# Replace this comment with code required for Try It 9. (Remember that this text is a comment, so R ignores it; you can delete it if you want.) If you don't delete it, **start your code on a new line that doesn't start with #**

# HINT: you might want to use some code from lab 7 to help you with this.

> **4.** Recall that we decided to lessen the number of cases in our data by taking a random sample from the data. Now let's assume that we can analyse the entire data representing every Stats 250 student, and we re-run the simulations and make a histogram accordingly. Do you expect the histogram of all possible differences in proportions for male and female Stats 250 students who would rather be a CEO to be a different shape, or the same shape? Do you expect the mean of the histogram of all possible differences in proportions to be the same, higher, or lower, than the mean found in the sample?
